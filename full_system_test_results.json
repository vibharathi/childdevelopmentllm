However, it's essential to note that some babies may start crawling earlier or later than this age range. Crawling is a significant milestone in a baby's physical development, and it's crucial to remember that every baby develops at their own pace. If you have concerns about your baby's development, it's always best to consult with your pediatrician.",

However, it's essential to remember that every child develops at their own pace. Some may take a little longer to master the skill. If your child is otherwise developing normally, such as communicating effectively, showing interest in their environment, and engaging in play, there's likely no cause for concern. However, if you notice any other red flags, such as delayed speech, difficulty with social interactions, or unusual physical abilities, consult with your pediatrician. They can assess your child's development and provide guidance on any necessary support or interventions.",
