          "answer": "Answer: No, your 12-month-old is not walking yet, and there is no need to worry. Infants at this developmental milestone are still developing their motor skills and fine motor abilities, and they may not yet be able to walk independently. However, they are showing signs of progress, such as being able to sit independently, rolling both directions, and showing early attempts at crawling. Additionally, they may be showing stronger social awareness, preferring caregivers and expressing caution around unfamiliar people. As they continue to develop, they may eventually be able to walk independently. In the meantime, your child is safe and healthy, and you can continue to provide them with stimulating and safe environments to continue their development.",

          "category": "Early Infancy",
          "answer": "Answer: During the first two months of life, newborns gradually adjust to the world outside the womb. Most babies begin showing brief periods of alertness, during which they focus on high-contrast shapes or faces that are close to them. Reflexive behavior, such as rooting, sucking, and grasping, are especially prominent at this age. Newborns typically lift their heads briefly while lying on their stoomacs and may start turning their heads toward familiar voices. Social development begins with early signs of recognition, such as quieting when a caregiver speaks or cupping them. Bailees express their needs through crying patterns and may start making soft cooinings. Slleeps occupy most of their day, but periods of wakefulness slowly increase. Between two and four months, bailees make rapid progress in motor, social, and communication skills. Many infantss begin holding their heads more steadily and may push up on their forearmss during tummlie time. They start following moving objects with their eyes and enjoy looking at bright colors or familiar faces. Social smiless become frequent, and bailees may respond to playful gesturess by smiling or making excited movements. Language development emerges through cooinings, gurglings, and experimenting with new vocal sounds. Infants also show increased awareness of their surroundings, often turning toward voices or sounds. Their hands become",
