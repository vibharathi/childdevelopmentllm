Q1: "When do babies typically start crawling?"
Category: Motor Development
================================================================================

EMBEDDING
  Answer    : "Between six and nine months, many babies begin showing early
              attempts at crawling. However, it's essential to note that some
              babies may start crawling earlier or later than this age range.
              Crawling is a significant milestone in a baby's physical
              development, and it's crucial to remember that every baby develops
              at their own pace. If you have concerns about your baby's
              development, it..."

HYBRID
  Answer    : "Typically, babies start crawling between six and nine months of
              age. However, the exact timing can vary from one child to another.
              Some may start crawling earlier, while others may take a bit
              longer. It's essential to remember that every baby develops at
              their own pace, and some might not crawl at all. Crawling is just
              one of many milestones that babies reach during this..."

                  04_late_infancy_6-9_months.txt     (age: 6-9,  score: 0.548)

VERDICT: GOOD (both)
  Both answers are factually correct and appropriately qualified. Embedding
  retrieves the most age-relevant source first (6-9 months). Hybrid's top-
  ranked document is the newborn doc (BM25 keyword noise), but the answer is
  unaffected. Hybrid is 14x faster here because no age filter is applied.

================================================================================
Q2: "My 12-month-old isn't walking yet. Should I be worried?"
Category: Developmental Concern
================================================================================

EMBEDDING
  Answer    : "At 12 months, most children take their first independent steps.
              If your child is not walking yet, it's worth discussing with your
              pediatrician. However, it's essential to remember that every child
              develops at their own pace. Some may take a little longer to
              master the skill. If your child is otherwise developing normally,
              such as communicating effectively, showing interest in their
              environment..."

HYBRID

  Retrieval time: 235ms
  Sources       : 06_early_toddlerhood_12-18_months.txt  (age: 12-18, score: 0.298)
                  05_transition_9-12_months.txt           (age: 9-12,  score: 0.278)

VERDICT: UNCERTAIN (both)
  Same sources, same answer, essentially equal speed. The direction is correct
  (don't panic, consult a pediatrician) but "most children take their first
  independent steps at 12 months" is a slight overstatement — the normal range
  extends to 15 months. Low scores on both reflect the nuanced nature of the
  question. Answer is also truncated mid-sentence (max_tokens limit).

================================================================================
Q3: "What social skills should I see at 18 months?"
Category: Social Development
================================================================================

EMBEDDING
  Answer    : "At 18 months, toddlers engage in simple imitation, such as
              pretending to talk on a toy phone or copying household routines.
              They also show interest in helping with simple tasks, such as
              putting toys away or wiping up small spills. Additionally, they
              may engage in simple communication, such as using two-word
              phrases. These social skills indicate that the child is becoming
              more independent and eager..."

VERDICT: GOOD — Embedding clearly better
  Same correct answer, same correct sources. Embedding scores notably higher
  (0.447 vs 0.357), which tips the confidence label from low to medium. Hybrid
  is also 2x slower despite returning identical results. Advantage: Embedding.

Q4: "Is it normal for a 6-month-old to not say words yet?"
Category: Language Development
================================================================================

EMBEDDING
  Answer    : "Yes, it is normal for a 6-month-old to not say words yet. At
              this stage, language development can vary significantly among
              babies. While some may start babbling with simple sounds or words
              around 6 months, others may not begin speaking until around 9-12
              months. If you have concerns about your baby's language
              development, it's always best to consult..."

                  03_middle_infancy_4-6_months.txt   (age: 4-6,  score: 0.378)

VERDICT: GOOD — Embedding clearly better
  Both answers are factually correct (first words come around 12 months; 6-month
  babbling is normal). Embedding scores higher (0.566 vs 0.417), giving medium
  vs low confidence. Hybrid's retrieval is an outlier at 2 seconds, likely due
  to BM25 rebuilding a filtered sub-corpus per query for the age filter.
  Advantage: Embedding.

================================================================================
Q5: "What can my newborn see?"
Category: Early Infancy
================================================================================

EMBEDDING
  Answer    : "High-contrast shapes or faces that are close to them.

              Explanation: This answer is based on the provided context, which
              states that newborns begin showing brief periods of alertness,
              during which they focus on high-contrast shapes or faces that are
              close to them. This indicates that newborns have limited visual
              acuity and can only see simple, high-contrast visual stimuli."
  Confidence    : medium
  Retrieval time: 161ms
  Sources       : 01_newborn_0-2_months.txt  (age: 0-2, score: 0.565)

HYBRID
  Answer    : [Identical to embedding answer]
  Confidence    : medium
  Retrieval time: 950ms
  Sources       : 01_newborn_0-2_months.txt  (age: 0-2, score: 0.452)

VERDICT: UNCERTAIN (both)
  The factual content is correct (high-contrast, close-up vision), but the
  answer starts mid-sentence with no subject — a prompt template issue where the
  LLM completes context rather than composing a full answer. Both strategies
  retrieve the same single source; the only difference is score (0.565 vs 0.452)
  and speed (161ms vs 950ms). Hybrid is 6x slower with just one matching
  document.

* Hybrid Q1 top score is misleading — it ranked a newborn doc first, not a crawling doc.

KEY FINDINGS

1. Answers are identical across both strategies for all 5 questions. The LLM
   produces the same output given equivalent retrieved content.

2. Embedding consistently retrieves higher-relevance chunks. Higher scores
   directly affect the confidence gate — if the top score falls below the
   threshold, no answer is generated at all.

3. Hybrid is only faster when no age filter is applied (Q1: 17ms vs 244ms).
   With age filtering active (Q2-Q5), Hybrid is consistently slower, sometimes
   dramatically so (Q4: 2004ms vs 182ms). BM25 rebuilds a filtered sub-corpus
   on each query, which has significant overhead.

4. The two UNCERTAIN answers (Q2, Q5) are strategy-independent. Q5 reflects a
   prompt template issue (answer starts mid-sentence). Q2 reflects a model
   knowledge limitation (walking timeline is slightly overstated).

5. Hybrid's top-ranked source for Q1 is factually wrong (newborn doc for a
   crawling question), which is a retrieval quality concern even if the final
   answer is not affected in this case.

CONCLUSION: Embedding (ChromaRetriever) is the stronger default strategy.
It retrieves more relevant sources, produces higher confidence scores, and is
faster across all age-filtered queries. Hybrid only wins on raw speed for
queries without an age filter, but at the cost of lower retrieval relevance.
